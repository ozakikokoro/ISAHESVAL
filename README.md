### What is ISAHESVAL ?  
ISAHESVAL is a bioinformatics pipeline written in bash, presumed to be implemented in linux machines. It is meant for analyzing nanopore transcriptome (or amplicon cDNA) reads with respect to splicing changes at the allele level, in combination with variant data provied by the user. It receive input files of a variant file (.vcf) and nanopore long-read cDNA/direct RNA sequencing data (.bam) which is mapped already and separate the nanopore reads into alleles, and calculate isoform using a well-known isoform analysis tool, FLAIR(a href=).
